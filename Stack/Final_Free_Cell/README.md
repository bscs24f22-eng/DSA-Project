Introduction

FreeCell Solitaire is a single-player card game based on logic and strategy. Unlike many other solitaire games, almost every FreeCell game is solvable if played correctly.

This project is an implementation of FreeCell Solitaire developed in C++ using Raylib, applying Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures & Algorithms concepts learned during the course.

Game Rules

The game uses a standard 52-card deck.

Cards are dealt into 8 tableau columns.

There are 4 Free Cells used for temporary card storage.

There are 4 Foundation piles, one for each suit.

Cards in tableau columns must be placed in descending order and alternating colors.

Only one card can be placed in a Free Cell at a time.

Foundation piles start with an Ace and build up to King of the same suit.

The goal is to move all cards to the foundation piles.
